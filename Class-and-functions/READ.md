1-Write a function called mul_time that takes a Time object and a number and returns a new Time object that contains the product of the original Time and the number.

Then use mul_time to write a function that takes a Time object that represents the finishing time in a race, and a number that represents the distance, and returns a Time object that represents the average pace (time per mile).

2-The DateTime module provides time objects that are similar to the Time objects in this chapter, but they provide a rich set of methods and operators. Read the documentation at http://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html.

1-Use the DateTime module to write a program that gets the current date and prints the day of the week.

2-Write a program that takes a birthday as input and prints the user’s age and the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until their next birthday.

3-For two people born on different days, there is a day when one is twice as old as the other. That’s their Double Day. Write a program that takes two birthdays and computes their Double Day.

4-For a little more challenge, write the more general version that computes the day when one person is n times older than the other.
